# Goal
This project shall provide easy and convenient ways to synchronize important data between my devices,
manage backups, aid in finding information by means of both fuzzy searches as well as tag based searching
and the use of filters. Furthermore the product shall be easily extensible through at least two mechanism
one of which being compile, the other runtime. The project shall facilitate higher degrees of automation 
for my daily workflow and be adaptable to new computers. It is to be built with future expansion in mind.
Performance is considered a primary goal, as is safety and reliability. 

# Concrete Feature list
- knowledge based
- markdown ed

- various degrees of authentication
- use database for linking, files for actual store?
- add ssh support
- support remote filesystems
- automatic drive monitoring
- support compression for special tags,categories, etc 
- categorie/tag based rules (e.g. downscale certain media) needs support for adding tags later
- add a web interface

- optimize for different disk types(caching,preload)
- packaging option for transfer to different computer
- bind to specific network interface(vpn bc port forward)
- connect to a remote server in addition to local server. Either in master/slave relation or distributed. Encryption is paramount.
- support parsing/serching in various file formats including but not limited to: office formats, open document
  formats, video and audio metadata
- automatically extract metadata and add it to the tag system

# Miscelaneous:
proper build system,learn rust, use more vim, add more snippets, use multiple languages for fun
